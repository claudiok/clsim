Release V00-02-00

* fixes a bug where particles that fall below the Cherenkov threshold are immediately killed in Geant4
* allows "device fission" to be used to make the photon propagator only use a fixed number of cores
* can send statistics to a I3SummaryService
* includes a new propagation mode where absorption is ignored (for generating photon-tables)
* comes with a preliminary version of photon-tabulation code
* flashers now have the appropriate time delay distributions
* allows Standard Candle simulation
* I3PhotonSeriesMap is now based on ModuleKey instead of OMKey (if available)
* support mDOM simulations when compatible dataclasses are available
* the safeprimes auto-downloader should be compatible with more systems now
* oversized DOMs are compressed to ellipsoids to get better timing distributions

Release V00-01-05

This is a minor release that should improve compatibility with
older nVidia cards (such as GTX 295) that do not have as much GPU
memory as newer cards. The maximum amount of memroy will now
only be used on nVidia cards that have either "Tesla", "GTX 580"
or "GTX 680" in their names.

Performance for large I3MCTrees should be significantly
improved in this release.
